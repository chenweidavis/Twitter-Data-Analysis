# Twitter-Data-Analysis

### Description 

Twitter's stream live data can be retrieved through Twitter's API once you have an Twitter developer account. Hence, we can utilize it to do some interesting data analysis or make some useful applications to serve our own purpose. This is a mini experimental project which makes an application for showing freqency of tweet's hashtags with stream live data.
